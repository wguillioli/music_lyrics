I know who you are and I know what you're feeling [x2]

Bad day at work
Crazy boss, crazy hours
Finger pointing, but then they depend on you
Inhale, exhale
In and out, like a sail
No, no. Ah yes.
Smile honey, no stress

When your environment seems to get brighter
(You know it's good)
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
(You know it's good)
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
(You know it's good)
Perception that you never had (you know if s good)

I want every woman to make a pledge with me...
Say your name
I pledge to live life on that edge
I want you to know I see the power is in me
No more acquiesce, standing up with no stress
I will do what I need until every woman on the earth is free

Let me tell you one more time
And I don't mind
I know what you're feeling

And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't wanna join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads and dance the moment's so surreal
Isn't it sad there's people in this world that don't know how this feels
