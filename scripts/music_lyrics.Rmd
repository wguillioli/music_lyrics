## Introduction 
I love music and data science. Purpose of this paper is to apply main text analytics techniques to explore lyrics from different authors.

We will see things like sentiment analysis, word clouds, topic model and network bigrams.

Purpose is to process lyrics and get idea of what they sign without reading lyrics.

A key companino for this was the book tidy text oby x (add link)

## Data and Methods
Lyrics from 4 albums were dowloaded from the azlyrics.com website. They were manually copy pasted to text documents and read into R.
Two albums for Iron Maiden - Number of the Beast (1982) and X-Factor (1995). For Taylor Swift, 1989 from 2014. And Pharrell Williams album x from x.

Data was read from txt into data frame. The techniques applied where: list all of them.

48 songs were analyzed from these albums: Iron Maiden: Number of the Beast	9, 		
Iron Maiden: X Factor	11, Pharrell Williams: GIRL	12, Taylor Swift: 1989	16.

Table 1 shows the names of the songs of each album.

```{r print_songs, echo=FALSE}

print(lyrics_df)

```



```{r data_prep, include=FALSE}

# tokenize lyrics per sentence
lyrics_sentences <- lyrics_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(song_line, lyrics, token = "lines") %>%
  mutate(artist_album_song = paste0(artist_album, song)) %>%
  group_by(artist_album_song) %>%
  mutate(song_line_number = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-artist_album_song)
    
# tokenize lyrics per word
lyrics_words <- lyrics_sentences %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, song_line) 
  
# remove stop words
lyrics_words <- lyrics_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)




```

The lyrics were split into invidual words for analysis and common words (stop words) like a, on, the were removed. Table 2  shows number of words for analysis:

```{r print_words, echo=FALSE}

# print # of words per album
lyrics_words %>%
  group_by(artist_album) %>%
  summarise(number_of_words = n())

```

## Results

To analyze text we start with x, then do y and then z.

### Top words used on the lyrics

We can start by plotting the top 10 most common words across all albums.

```{r plot_top10, echo=FALSE}

# plot top 10 most common words
lyrics_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word,n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +
  geom_col(fill = blue_palette[2]) +
  cust_theme

```

This is relatively interesting but not useful since we know some artists use more words than others. So let's do the same but by album.

```{r plot_top_album, echo=FALSE}

# most common words per album
lyrics_words %>% 
  count(artist_album, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(artist_album) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) %>% 
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(n, word, fill = artist_album)) +
    geom_col(fill = blue_palette[2],
             show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~artist_album, scales = "free") +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = NULL) +
  cust_theme

 

# add plot

```

### Sentiment 
The top words above give an idea of what they talk about but it's just the start. The next thing is to see if they sing about happy, sad or angry stuff. Probably a bit of everything. 

We start with a simple analysis to see if the sentiment is positive or negative. In the chart below we see the sentiment evolution of the albums as the album progress where each bar represents a line in the song. Also note that number of lines varies and Maiden sings with less words.   


```{r plot_sentiment, echo=FALSE}

# plot sentiment change by album (calculated by line)
albumns_sentiment <- lyrics_words %>%
  inner_join(bing) %>%
  count(artist_album, song_line_number, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

ggplot(albumns_sentiment, aes(song_line_number, sentiment, fill = artist_album)) +
  geom_col(fill = blue_palette[2],
           show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~artist_album, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x") +
  cust_theme
```

Several points to highlight from this chart. Iron Maiden tends to be very negative while Taylor Swift is mostly negative with some exceptions. Pharrell Williams on the contrary seems to be a very happy and uplifting singer. We will explore why and more in the next section.  

Another thing we can do is to see the sentiment for each album. Maiden is motly about fear, sadness and anger. While Pharrell sings about Joy and Trust. While Taylor seems to be happier but sometimes is inundated with sadness and fear. As we will see later this is a diffrent fear than the one Maiden shows.

```{r plot_sent_album, echo=FALSE}

# top sentiments per album
nrc_filtered <- nrc %>%
  filter(sentiment != "positive" & sentiment != "negative")

lyrics_words %>%
  inner_join(nrc_filtered, relationship = "many-to-many") %>%

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
