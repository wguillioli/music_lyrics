I get in from work at 2 AM and sit down with a beer
Turn on late night TV and then I wonder why I am here
It's meaningless and trivial and it washes over me
And once again I wonder, "Is this all there is for me?"

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Life seems so pathetic, I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed, these walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better that just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on and try to take the hurt?

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own

Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own

Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Alone again
Alone again
I'm here on my own
