Just because it's the middle of the night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
'Cause something deep inside
Is pulling me and I want you now
You and I should be getting it right
Ain't no sense in you roaming around
If I can't have you nobody can
This is an animal speaking that'll hunt you down

So baby (woo-hoo)
My love is calling (woo-hoo)
Hey baby (woo-hoo)
My love is calling (woo-hoo)
Hey baby (woo-hoo)
Sex is calling (woo-hoo)
Hey baby (woo-hoo)
My love is calling (woo-hoo)

I am showing my teeth
And I hope you know that look in my eye (hey!)
I've got lightning speed
I won't hesitate to rescue what is mine (hey!)

Well hold up baby what's going on?
Tell the truth I wanna know
Whatchu doing when you gone?
Something say you ain't alone
You say "baby keep holding on"
Whatchu mean? I been holding on
I ain't never smelt this before
Something say it's time to go

Just because it's the middle of the night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down

If I can't have you nobody can
This is an animal speaking that'll hunt you down

With a full description of the kill and cause
I'm a hunter

But you can't aim and get what I get
I'm a hunter

Duck dynasty is cool and all
But they got nothing on the female's call
I'm a hunter
Is that a tree or is that camouflage?
Come get eaten by the damn mirage
I'm a hunter

You know what's in my blood
