Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled

War horse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

Once a ploughman hitches his team
Here he sowed?
His little dream
Now bodies, arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying, lie
I'm left alone asking why

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

War is over and battles are gone
After the war that no one has won
I'm just soldier

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
