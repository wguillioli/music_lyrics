Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry
But when you can see it happening
Madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry

Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands

Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire
They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
Someone should
