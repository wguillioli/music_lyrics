My heart is filled with love and care
Not an ounce of gas I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here I see all the stars
Ooh there go Venus and there go Mars
Something you've been through
You're from above, hey

When I first saw you I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, trying to hide it
But I didn't know, I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me, while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You're supposed to let it go

Like a gust of wind you head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind you push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind you remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in the air I need to power my sail

When I open the window
I wanna hug you, 'cause you remind me of the air
I said it yeah
'Cause when I'm feeling real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

With your love I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away?
Can I stow away girl?
Colorful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
'Cause we're color, you blow me away
Blow me away girl girl

I need it like I breathe it
(Music and colours can make one hover)
Who cares if they don't see it?
(Don't you know that they're the same?)

I need it like I breathe it
(If you never discover, forever you'll suffer)
Who cares if they don't see it?
(Gotta tap in and learn the way)

Like a gust of wind you head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind you push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind you remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in the air I need to power my sail

When I open the window
I wanna hug you, 'cause you remind me of the air
I said it yeah
'Cause when I'm feeling real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

When I first saw you I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, trying to hide it
But I didn't know, I didn't let go
Then I realised I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know
Oh, I had to let it go

Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes (off sometimes, yeah)
Like a gust of wind (hey hey)
You push me back every once in a while (once in a while)
Like a gust of wind (yeah)
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in (hey hey)
The air I need to power my sail (hey!)

When I open the window
I wanna hug you, 'cause you remind me of the air
I said it yeah
'Cause when I'm feeling real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
