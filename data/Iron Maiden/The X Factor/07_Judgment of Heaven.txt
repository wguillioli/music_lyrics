A lonely cry for help preaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind

You question your beliefs
Your inner thoughts, your whole existence
And if there is a god, then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
If you had the chance again
Would you change the thing at all?
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong?

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
