The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me
Like a wine stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Said, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean
