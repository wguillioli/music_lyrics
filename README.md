## What Are Iron Maiden, Taylor Swift, and Pharrell Williams Singing About?
### A Primer on Using Text Mining Techniques to Analyze Music Lyrics

Do heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden exclusively explore themes of darkness and the occult in their lyrics? Conversely, do pop artists like Taylor Swift and Pharrell Williams focus solely on themes of love and positive emotions? Is it possible to employ text-mining techniques to analyze and understand the thematic content of song lyrics without the need for exhaustive manual reading?

In this project, I apply basic text-mining techniques to these lyrics. I begin by identifying the most common words and then examine the emotional tone of these words. Next, I explore how individual words contribute to the overall emotional landscape of an album. Finally, I investigate how words combine together to provide deeper insights, highlighting some of the limitations of relying solely on single-word or unigram analysis.

### Data
